# nodejscourse
This repository contains most of the fundamentals of using Node.js on the server-side. Many of the problems and code samples were created from Andrew Mead's Complete Node.js Developer Course 2 on [https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2](Udemy). I recommend this course if you're looking for more in depth explanations about each of the parts of this repository, however I've tried to comment it the best I can.

# Includes
There are many things that the code samples in this repository can teach you, such as:
* Node
* Npm
* Asynchronous programming
* MongoDB
* Express
* Socket.IO
* Authentication with JWTs
* Mongoose
* Deploying apps with Heroku
* Version control with Git
* GitHub
* Code testing
* Application debugging
* Awesome new ES6 features
* Mocha
* And more!

However, as said before, this is generally to be used as a reference. If you are completely new to Node, I'd suggest looking more in depth to each of the individual modules and features to get a better understanding of these examples.
